# Klon Centaur Model

This repository contains a digital model of the Klon Centaur 
guitar pedal. The goal is to use this circuit as a test
bench for comparing/combining linear circuit methods, wave 
digital filters, and neural network circuit modelling
approaches.

Eventually, the models will be implemented as both
an audio plugin (VST/AU), and as a guitar pedal-style
effect embedded on the Teensy microcontroller.
